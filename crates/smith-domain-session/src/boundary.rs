//! The records that cross the boundary with the session's parent, the
//! root domain (programming-model.md, section 4.5), which routes them to and from the protocol layer and
//! the session's opener. The session defines them; its parent depends on it.
//! Contracts: domain/session.md, sections 3–7.
//! This module retains no runtime state and knows no provider wire format,
//! host policy or checkout contents; [`Event`] and [`Request`] are the typed
//! entrances and exits for the stateful session module.
//!
//! Two shapes cross it. A session's lifecycle, with its opener: an
//! [`Event::Open`] is answered by exactly one [`Request::Ended`], after an
//! [`Request::Opened`] that names the session if it was admitted, and any
//! number of [`Request::Yielded`] and [`Request::Used`] in between; the opener
//! addresses the session by that name, and every record back carries the
//! opener's token (programming-model.md, section 4.2). Each request has one
//! terminal event: a [`Request::Complete`] is ended by one of [`Event::Completed`],
//! [`Event::Failed`] or [`Event::Cancelled`], or by [`Event::BudgetDenied`]
//! when the root withholds it before any provider lease, or [`Event::UnsentClosed`]
//! when the run closes before publication; a [`Request::Delegate`], to the
//! opener, by [`Event::Answered`] or [`Event::AnswerCancelled`]; a
//! [`Request::Io`], the tools' file and process operations passed on as they
//! are, by [`Event::Done`]. A request's `owner` is echoed on its terminal
//! event: the session's token for a call to the LLM, a tool run's own for a
//! delegated call, and the tools' own for an operation.
