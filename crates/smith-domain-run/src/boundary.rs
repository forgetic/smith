//! The records that cross the boundary with the run's parent, the top-level
//! domain (programming-model.md, section 4.5). The run defines them; its parent depends on it.
//! Contracts: domain/run.md, sections 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10;
//! protocol/channel.md, sections 4, 5 and 7; protocol/transcript.md, section 2.
//!
//! All three of the run's faces cross here:
//!
//! - The host's, which the parent routes to and from the protocol layer. A
//!   [`Event::Start`] is a call, answered by exactly one [`Request::Answer`].
//!   An admitted run is named by [`Request::Admitted`] first, so that a
//!   [`Event::Cancel`] can name it. A run's host call, [`Request::Deliver`], is
//!   ended by exactly one [`Event::Delivered`]. After submission the
//!   host operation is never abandoned; its deadline bounds the host terminal.
//!   Duplicate or stale callback owners are inert (domain/run.md, sections 8 and 10).
//! - io's, for what the run itself does in its checkout, which the parent
//!   routes to and from the protocol layer. A [`Request::Read`] is ended by
//!   exactly one [`Event::Read`], a [`Request::Probe`] by one
//!   [`Event::Probed`], and a [`Request::Check`] by one [`Event::Checked`],
//!   or after a [`Request::Abort`] by [`Event::Aborted`] if the abort won.
//!   Each carries its deadline, and io runs the race (programming-model.md, section 5.3).
//! - The conversations', which the parent translates to and from the session
//!   child domain's vocabulary. A [`Request::Open`] is ended by exactly one
//!   [`Event::Ended`], after a [`Event::Started`] unless the conversation was
//!   refused at its entrance. Every event about a conversation carries the
//!   run's token for it, `conversation`; the run addresses a conversation by
//!   `peer`, the token it gave back when it started (programming-model.md, section 4.2). A conversation's
//!   [`Event::Delegated`] call is ended by exactly one [`Request::Return`],
//!   after an [`Event::Withdraw`] too; the call is named by the
//!   conversation's own token for it, `call`. It carries its deadline, and
//!   the run runs the race: past it, the run stops work before submission and
//!   returns it as timed out once that settles. A submitted delivery always
//!   owes its host terminal, including after withdrawal or expiry;
//!   caller-only expiry does not decide the run's shutdown (domain/run.md, 8.2 and 10).
//!
//! A request's `owner` is the run's token for what asked: the run itself for
//! a read or a probe, or a delivery call for a check and its abort or host
//! submission. Submitted host delivery has no cancellation request.
//! It is echoed on the terminal.
