//! The agent root (domain/run.md, sections 2, 3 and 10;
//! programming-model.md, sections 4.4 and 4.5). It owns the run and session
//! children, opaque credential names and validity, conversation bindings,
//! tool tickets, deferred handoffs and bounded observation queues.
//! Bounded Start contexts retain the original reply rights and optional history;
//! single-use concrete Turn handoffs own records crossing the sibling seam
//! (domain/run.md, section 13).
//!
//! [`step`], [`fire`] and [`resume`] accept typed host, provider and IO events
//! with injected clocks and seed. They emit owned [`Request`] values within
//! [`max_out`]; the caller reserves output room and returns each request's
//! one typed terminal. Iteration-end reclamation follows output delivery.
//! The root translates run conversations into sessions; siblings share no
//! state or vocabulary, and tools remain beneath sessions.
//!
//! The `host_run` fields carry opaque logical run identities supplied by the host.
//! A host process or byte protocol is not required
//! to call this typed domain. The domain never knows credential secrets,
//! authentication, channel bytes, forge state, CI, posting or merge policy.
//! IO owns confined paths and process effects; the host owns delivery.
//! Content-free facts may be dropped and never decide behavior. Owned content
//! observations are separately drained or discarded by the caller.
