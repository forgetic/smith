//! The records that cross the boundary with the protocol layer (programming-model.md, section 4.4;
//! domain/run.md, sections 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 13;
//! domain/session.md, sections 3–6). The
//! domain defines them; the protocol crate depends on it.
//!
//! Three peers are behind it, and each record names which by its variant:
//!
//! - The host, the run child domain's face. A [`Event::Start`] is a call,
//!   answered by exactly one [`Request::Answer`], after a
//!   [`Request::Admitted`] that names the run if it was admitted, so that a
//!   [`Event::Cancel`] can name it. A run's host call, [`Request::Deliver`], is
//!   ended by exactly one [`Event::Delivered`]. After submission the
//!   host operation is never abandoned; its deadline bounds the host terminal.
//!   Duplicate or stale callback owners are inert (domain/run.md, sections 8 and 10).
//!   [`Request::Checking`] is a notice, with no terminal.
//! - LLM providers, for the sessions: a [`Request::Complete`] is ended by one
//!   of [`Event::Completed`], [`Event::Failed`] or, after a
//!   [`Request::Cancel`] that won its race, [`Event::Cancelled`]. Its prompt
//!   and its completion are in the conversation vocabulary ([`crate::llm`]):
//!   a prompt's messages hold text, tool calls sent back as the LLM wrote
//!   them, and their results (the tools' outcome, the run's answer to a tool
//!   it serves, the problem of a call that is none, or not run); a
//!   completion holds text and tool calls, each decoded into a call to the
//!   session's own tools, an ask of a tool the run serves, or a problem.
//! - io, in two families of records for now: the file and process operations
//!   of the sessions' tools, as the tools define them (a [`Request::Io`] is
//!   ended by [`Event::Done`], with `Cancelled` if a [`Request::CancelIo`]
//!   won its race), and the run's own looks in its checkout and
//!   its checks (a [`Request::Read`] by [`Event::Read`], a [`Request::Probe`]
//!   by [`Event::Probed`], a [`Request::Check`] by [`Event::Checked`], or
//!   after a [`Request::Abort`] by [`Event::Aborted`] if the abort won). They
//!   share a shape (a command run as a contained process, in a root, with a
//!   deadline, is a check for the run and a shell call for the tools), and
//!   become one vocabulary once the io layer is designed. Every io request
//!   carries its deadline, and io runs the race (programming-model.md, section 5.3).
//!
//! A request's `owner` is the token of whoever asked, echoed on its terminal
//! event. Tokens of different families may be equal: the variant routes a
//! terminal to the child domain that asked.
