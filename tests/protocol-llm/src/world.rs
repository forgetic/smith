//! The scripted shell for the copied domain tree (domain/host.md, sections 2
//! and 11; domain/run.md, section 14). It keeps schedules, pending boundary
//! requests, checkout bytes and observations; it never uses private state to
//! choose replies. Only final quiescence checks read public domain counters.
//! An opt-in wire composition retains actual Clients separately from root callback
//! lookup, exposes byte-peer queries, and closes physical owners bottom-up. The
//! root's iteration supplies both clocks; pending wire progress prevents timer
//! jumps. Provider grammar and generic stream scheduling remain unknown here.
//! Exactly one backend is selected before construction: wire worlds retain no
//! unused typed provider, provider queues or provider-call ledger.
//! Entrances are original Start, bounded drive, parent message/cancel and wall
//! injection (scratch/client.md, sections 1, 4 and 5; programming-model.md, section 9).
//! The separate parent-delivery entrance exposes whole actual submissions and
//! retains their existing flight/snapshot until an actual outside terminal is
//! scheduled. It never chooses that parent's durable decision or fabricates a
//! channel return (domain/run.md, section 8.2; domain/host.md, section 9).
